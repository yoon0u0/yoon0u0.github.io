- **Supporting an Iterative Conversation Design Process (2019.03 - Now)**
Conversation design is an essential step in building a chatbot. Much like designing visual user interfaces, designing conversations benefits from prototyping and testing with users to explore and improve possible and existing conversation flows. However, it can be overwhelming to quickly iterate the conversation design as the iterative process requires not only the conversation design but also building and testing a working chatbot equipped with the conversation. We developed _ProtoChat_, a prototype system that supports an iterative design of conversation by allowing designers to (1) prototype conversations, (2) test the conversations with crowds, and (3) review and analyze the crowdsourced conversation data. Results of an exploratory study with four conversation designers show that the designers successfully iterated on their conversation design by reviewing how crowds followed the conversation, which provided insights on concrete action items to improve their conversation design.

- **Integrating Reflection and Practice into Video Learning Improves Learning Experience and Design Performance (2018.08 - Now, collaborated with [Janet Huang](http://janetyc.github.io))**
Learners use online videos to acquire new knowledge to perform complex tasks. However, novices face challenges in applying knowledge to the task to achieve high-quality outcomes. This work explores a scaffolding structure to support video learners to learn through and from experience towards the goal of performing design tasks. We introduce the Reflection-Practice workflow to support a reflective video learning process. Furthermore, we introduce the scaffolded prompting to facilitate reflection and revision to improve work performance. We conducted two studies with 82 crowdworkers to understand the effect of our reflective design on poster design tasks. Results show that participants reported an increase in self-efficacy and improved design quality after following our workflow; participants who got Scaffolded prompting reported a higher willingness to improve their design than without prompting. Our findings show that integrating reflection and practice into video learning can improve learning experience and ultimately lead to better outcomes.
